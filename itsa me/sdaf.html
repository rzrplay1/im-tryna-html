            <p>One day, Princess Peach called Mario to her castle with an offer to eat the cake she baked and drink tea. Mario arrives at the castle and hears Bowser laughing loudly . Mario meets one of the Toads, who tells him that Bowser has kidnapped the princess and the stars of the castle to create his own world in the paintings and walls, and is not letting anyone out so that they do not call for help. Mario travels through the empty castle and jumps into paintings, after which the level begins. At first, one level is available in which you need to collect 7 stars. After gaining a certain number of stars, new levels appear and access to new doors. There are also locked doors behind which battles with Bowser await. In battles with him, you need to grab him by the tail and throw him on the bombs. If Mario loses all his hit points, he is eliminated from the level. Mario in the game can do a huge number of tricks and movements; there are bonuses in the form of caps, with the help of which Mario can fly, become invisible and metallic. After performing certain actions on a level, certain bonuses are unlocked in the form of additional blocks and guns, with the help of which Mario can get into secret places. Life points are called energy. When receiving damage it decreases. You can replenish it by collecting coins with the image of a star. By collecting green mushrooms, you can get an extra life. Mario goes into the drawings and finds all 120 stars. After the final battle with Bowser, Princess Peach thanks Mario and they go out for tea together. </p>

            <p>The game begins with a storyline that is typical of other Mario games. The villain Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach , but this time for the specific purpose  of marrying her. At the very beginning, Mario is defeated by Bowser and loses his red hat. Soon the hero meets a hat ghost named Cappy , who offers his help. His sister Tiara was also kidnapped by Bowser, who he wants to use as a crown for Peach, and the ghost offers to team up to find and defeat Bowser.
                The heroes begin to travel around the world, on the heels of the Villain on the flying ship-hat "Odyssey". They realize that Bowser has been ravaging the local kingdoms and stealing their most valuable items to prepare for his wedding, such as a wedding dress from the Lake Kingdom or a cake from the Snow Kingdom. As the hero strives to catch up with Bowser, a gang of hares, Broodals, stands in his  way . Mario must fight each of them and restore order to the kingdoms.
                Ultimately, Mario reaches his final destination - the moon to disrupt the wedding ceremony of Bowser and Princess Peach. He defeats the villain in the final battle, rescues Peach from the collapsing dungeon, taking possession of Bowser's body. Mario then takes the opportunity to propose to Princess Peach, but Bowser tries to do so at the same time. They begin to compete with each other, tactlessly invading Peach's personal space, and the offended princess rejects the proposal of both, intending to return to Earth on the Odyssey. Mario goes with her, but Bowser remains on the moon.</p>
